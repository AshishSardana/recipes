# Firecrawl by Mendable

Firecrawl is a AI first web scraping tool that allows you to easily crawl and extract clean, structured data from websites for use in LLM applications. It handles the complexities of web scraping like proxies, caching, rate limits, and dynamic content, delivering markdown or JSON output that is ready to be ingested into vector databases like Weaviate.

## Some key features of Firecrawl:

Crawls all accessible subpages of a website, even without a sitemap
Extracts content from webpages that use JavaScript to render
Returns the scraped data as clean, well-formatted markdown or structured JSON
Orchestrates parallel crawling for fast results
Built-in caching to avoid unnecessary re-scraping
Designed specifically for AI/LLM use cases

## How Firecrawl Works
Firecrawl makes it simple to extract clean, structured data from websites through a straightforward process:

1. Specify the URL(s) you want to crawl. This can be a single webpage, a list of pages, or an entire website. Firecrawl will automatically discover and crawl all accessible subpages.
2. Firecrawl handles the crawling process, navigating through the website's structure and rendering any dynamic content generated by JavaScript. It extracts the main textual content from each page, ignoring extraneous elements like headers, footers, and navigation.
3. The extracted content is cleaned up and formatted into your choice of markdown documents or structured JSON objects. Each webpage becomes its own document or JSON object, complete with the page's URL and the extracted text content.
4. Firecrawl returns this cleaned, structured data for you to use however you need. The output format is designed to be easily ingested by AI/LLM applications and tools.
5. You can then take the Firecrawl output and import it into your database, feed it into your machine learning models, use it to build a knowledge base, or any other application you have in mind. The data is ready to be used without any further cleaning or pre-processing needed.

Firecrawl takes care of all the complexities of web scraping - handling site maps, following links, dealing with rate limits, rendering JavaScript, cleaning up messy HTML - and gives you back clean, usable data in a standardized format.

## Example Firecrawl Output
Here's an example of what the scraped output from Firecrawl might look like for a simple website:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://www.example.com/",
    "markdown": "## Welcome to Example Co\nExample Co is the leading innovator in example products and services..."
  },
  {
    "url": "https://www.example.com/about",
    "markdown": "## About Example Co\nFounded in 2015, Example Co's mission is to..."
  },
  {
    "url": "https://www.example.com/products",
    "markdown": "## Our Products\n### Example Product 1\nOur flagship example product enables..." 
  }
]
```
