# Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases is "The AI developer platform" helping AI developers to "build models faster, fine-tune LLMs, develop GenAI applications with confidence, all in one system of record developers are excited to use".

We currently have an example of using wandb logging to monitor optimizing a RAG system with DSPy, Weaviate, and Cohere!
