# Welcome to the Weaviate Recipes repository!

This repo covers end-to-end examples on the various features and integrations with [Weaviate](www.weaviate.io)! Here is an outline of the folders:

## Similarity Search üîé
[Similarity Search](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/tree/main/similarity-search) shows how to run `nearText`, `nearObject` and `nearVector` queries in Weaviate. It is divided by the different providers:

* [Cohere](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_cohere.ipynb)
* [Contextionary](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_contextionary.ipynb)
* [HuggingFace](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_huggingface.ipynb)
* [OpenAI](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_openai.ipynb)
* [PaLM](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_palm.ipynb)
* [Transformers](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/similarity-search/text2vec/similarity_search_transformers.ipynb)

## Hybrid Search ‚öñÔ∏è
[Hybrid Search](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/tree/main/hybrid-search) allows you to combine keyword and vector search. The notebook covers how to run a hybrid search query, search on a specific property, add in a `where` filter, and how to search with an embedding. It is divided by the different providers:

* [Cohere](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_cohere.ipynb)
* [Contextionary](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_contextionary.ipynb)
* [HuggingFace](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_huggingface.ipynb)
* [OpenAI](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_openai.ipynb)
* [PaLM](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_palm.ipynb)
* [Transformers](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/hybrid-search/hybrid_search_transformers.ipynb)

## Generative Search ‚å®Ô∏è
[Generative Search](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/tree/main/generative-search) allows you to improve your search results by piping them through LLM models. It is divided by the different providers:

* [Cohere](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/generative-search/generative_search_cohere.ipynb)
* [OpenAI](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/generative-search/generative_search_openai.ipynb)
* [PaLM](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/generative-search/generative_search_palm.ipynb)
