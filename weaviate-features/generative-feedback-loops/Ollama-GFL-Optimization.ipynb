[In Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/), Ben Thompson writes about how the free distribution of the internet allowed companies to modularize (or unbundle) services and focus on user experience.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program appears to be designed to solve the task of generating a new or updated property value given a property name, references, and instructions. The particular use case highlighted here indicates that the task focuses on generating \"inspired queries\" based on given content. The system prompts the user to provide a property name, some contexts (referred as 'references'), and instructions to modify or create a new property value. Within the contexts, there's existing content and the instruction sets a demand for constructing a deep, insightful question based on the given content. The question should not repeat the keywords from the content and should illuminate the advantages of semantic search with vector embeddings over traditional methods. In the examples, the 'instruction' and 'property_name' remain constant, while 'references' change for each case which is a snippet from different blog posts. The 'property_value' which the model generates is an insightful question derived from the 'references' in line with the 'instruction'. The program uses a language model, presumably a transformer-like model, to perform the task. The input to the model includes the property name, context information from the references, and the instructions on what should be done. The model then generates the output which is the required property value that adheres to the instruction given, which in this case, is a query. In the operational workflow, the model first initiates the `Program` class which contains a module to perform prediction based on the model. Within the `forward` function, the model predicts the property value using the provided `property_name`, `references`, and `instructions`. The returned value is then extracted and put out as a prediction, which is the desired property value generated in line with the given instruction.\n",

The printing press significantly reduced the cost of reproducing information, while the internet cut out the middleman, making the distribution of information virtually free. [In Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/), Ben Thompson writes about how the free distribution of the internet allowed companies to modularize (or unbundle) services and focus on user experience. Ben states that “companies that win the user experience can generate a virtuous cycle where their ownership of consumers/users attracts suppliers which improves the user experience”.\n",

      "Large Language Models are heralding a new era in information technology. To better understand this revolution, it’s important to consider the historical context. The printing press significantly reduced the cost of reproducing information, while the internet cut out the middleman, making the distribution of information virtually free. [In Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/), Ben Thompson writes about how the free distribution of the internet allowed companies to modularize (or unbundle) services and focus on user experience. Ben states that “companies that win the user experience can generate a virtuous cycle where their ownership of consumers/users attracts suppliers which improves the user experience”.\n",

      "Large Language Models are heralding a new era in information technology. To better understand this revolution, it’s important to consider the historical context. The printing press significantly reduced the cost of reproducing information, while the internet cut out the middleman, making the distribution of information virtually free. [In Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/), Ben Thompson writes about how the free distribution of the internet allowed companies to modularize (or unbundle) services and focus on user experience. Ben states that “companies that win the user experience can generate a virtuous cycle where their ownership of consumers/users attracts suppliers which improves the user experience”.\n",

The syntax is straightforward, and the potential for memory-related bugs (such as memory leaks) is low. At the same time, it's not uncommon to have Go programs spend considerably less than 1% of their CPU time on GC-related activities. Given how little the average program is optimized for execution efficiency, trading in just 1% of execution time is a pretty good deal.
