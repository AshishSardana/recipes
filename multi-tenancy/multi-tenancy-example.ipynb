    "# üóÇÔ∏è Multi-Tenancy in Weaviate\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this demo notebook! Here, we'll walk you through a small example showcasing the `Multi-Tenancy` function in Weaviate.\n",
    "Multi-tenancy is a key feature in Weaviate, allowing for the efficient and secure management of data across multiple users or tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìñ Further Reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the concept in depth in the [multi-tenancy blog post](https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search).\n",
    "- Dive into the technical details in our [Weaviate developer documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy#enable-multitenancy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "Before we dive in, there are a few preliminary steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set Up a Weaviate Cluster: \n",
    "This notebook requires a working Weaviate cluster. If you don't have one, fret not! You can set up a free sandbox Weaviate cluster by following our [comprehensive guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/hello_weaviate/set_up).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Virtual Environment and Dependencies: \n",
    "To ensure smooth execution and prevent potential conflicts with your global Python environment, we recommend running the code in a virtual environment. Later in this notebook, we'll guide you through setting up this environment and installing the necessary dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these points in mind, let's get started!"

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the notebook content, it's essential to set up an isolated Python environment. This helps avoid any potential package conflicts and ensures that you have a clean workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Environment Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't created a virtual environment before, here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `virtualenv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install virtualenv\n",
    "python -m virtualenv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `venv` (built-in with Python 3.3+):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ".\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "macOS and Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the virtual environment active, run the following code to install all the required dependencies for this notebook:"
